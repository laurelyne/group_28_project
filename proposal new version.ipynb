    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Abalones are a type of mollusk that are found in marine environments and commonly considered a delicacy in a plethora of cuisines and their popularity is reflected by their price, costing up to 100$ per shell, (The Pricer, 2021). Consequently, many species of this marine mollusk have been classified as endangered. This prompted scientific research into their populations (Kerlin, 2022) which requires knowing the age stratification. Determining the age of an abalone involves cutting the shell, staining it, and counting the rings that are formed perennially using a microscope. \n",
    "The tediousness of this procedure inspired our group to explore the following question: Can the age of an abalone can be predicted based on several measurements describing its dimensions and weight using a regression model in R?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using to answer this question give various statistics on the physical characteristics of 4178 different mollusks.  These statistics include the length, diameter, height, weight, shucked weight, viscera weight (this is the gut weight after bleeding), shell weight (after being dried) and number of rings of these mollusks..  One categorical variable they use is sex of the mollusk which can be male, female, or infant (infant is a category because mollusks can switch sexes) (Kaggle, n.d.).   We also added the variable age, which is the number of rings plus 1.5 (Nash & Sellers, 1994).\n"
