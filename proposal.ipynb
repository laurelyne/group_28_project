    "\n",
    "Abalones are a type of mollusk that are found in marine environments and commonly considered a delicacy in many cuisines (costing up to 100$ per shell üò®, (The Pricer, 2021)). This has placed many species of Abalone in endangered species lists and have prompted scientific research into their population tendencies, (Kerlin, 2022). Part of the research conducted involves determining the age of individuals by cutting the shell, staining it, and counting the rings that are formed perennially using a microscope. This is a very tedious process, so scientists have resorted to other measurements performed on the abalones to predict their age (Nash & Sellers, 1994).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we are thus aiming to answer through our project is the following: Can the age of an abalone be predicted based on several measurements describing its dimensions and weight using a model using R?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using to answer this question give various statistics on the physical characteristics of 4178 different mollusks.  These statistics include the length, diameter, height, weight, shucked weight, viscera weight (weight of soft inside), shell weight and number of rings of these mollusks.  One categorical variable they use is sex of the mollusk which can be male, female, or infant (infant is a category because mollusks can switch sexes) (Kaggle, n.d.)."
